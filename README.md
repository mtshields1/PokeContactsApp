PokeContactsApp
--------------------
An Android application that lists the user's contacts with added Pokemon extras

This Android project allows the user to do all of the usual contact list actions; call or text a contact. Pokemon aesthetics
were added, hence the project's name. Besides the usual phone actions, each contact has it's own Pokemon avatar from the
original 150. This avatar can, of course, be changed, for all contacts. In addition, an alphabetic bar for fastscrolling to contacts
was added for easier and quicker navigation of contacts
